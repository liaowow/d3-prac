## Overview

The name d3 comes from the three D’s in the term “Data-Driven Documents.”

Key Features:
- d3 revolutionized the way data visualizations are built natively for the web by associating data with elements on a website’s Document Object Model.
- d3 is a visually elegant library that offers a wide range of pre-packaged visualizations (from Tree-models to Sankey funnels)
- d3 leaves a lot of room for creative customization because the elements the data are bound to can be styled like any regular DOM element
- d3 supports interactivity triggered by browser events


### Selection

For D3 to inject or bind data to elements, a D3 selection of elements needs to be created. 
D3 selections are created with the `.selectAll()` or `.select()` methods.
- The `.select()` method returns the first element that matches a selector string.
- The `.selectAll()` returns an array-like structure with grouped nodes for all the elements that match the selector.
